        <li>Can you be your true self around him, without any fear of being judged or criticized?</li>
        <li>Are you able to openly share your worries and concerns with him, without fearing his reaction?</li>
        <li>Do you feel genuinely supported by him in your decisions and personal goals?</li>
        <li>Does your relationship inspire you to be a better version of yourself, or do you feel it holds you back in some way?</li>
        <li>Have you noticed any behaviors or attitudes you've adopted in this relationship that you don't like or that feel unhealthy to you?</li>
        <li>How do you both handle disagreements or conflicts? Do you feel truly heard and respected during these times?</li>
        <li>When you think about your personal goals and dreams, do you believe your current relationship will help you achieve them?</li>
        <li>Do you think your connection is based on healthy experiences, or it's more like a trauma bond?</li>
